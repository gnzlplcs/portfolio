      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>Finding out a lot of information about API fetch, API sources, documentation, and so on.</p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>In this moment, I'm working hard in orden to finish the final project.</p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?
      </h3>
      <p>I had to change my final project's API source many times, because the documentation was not very well. That seemed a waste of time and a increment of anxiety. However, I was finally able to find out a good API source, and my final project is in 70%.</p>
