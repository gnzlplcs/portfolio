      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>From the last meeting I read the chapter for this week and took notes. I also saw videos about Auth in Traversy Media and Web Dev channel. About the final project, I've studied more about MVC organization, because although I can understand in theory, it's a little difficult for me to deploy it in code.</p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>This week I have to dedicate the 100% of my time to init the final project. I have the idea and start the first lines of code, but I have too much for doing.
      </p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?
      </h3>
      <p>This week I felt frustrating because the Team activity was difficult to me. I followed all the steps, however I could not see the output in the console. When I have a little more time, I will try explore and deep more in this topic.</p>
