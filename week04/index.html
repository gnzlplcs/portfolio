      <h2>Weekly Report 4</h2>
      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>From the last week, I was checking the <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> book, in order to get
        some comprehension about dense topics like objects. I did not know how many methods exist to
        manipulate objects.</p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>I wanted to practice more methods, like mapping arrays, destructuring objects, etc. I also
        have to enhance my knowledge about the DOM, and how to invoke their elements from JS.
        Finally, in order to remember concepts I will check all my notes since week 1. I wouldn't
        want to forget important topics, just for not checking them.
      </p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?
      </h3>
      <p>It was hard to get the appropriate methods to fetch HTML elements in JavaScript. I spent
        much time trying to iterate into all classNames for the tic-tac-toe game, when the solution
        was iterate from the class container. I need to practice more examples like that.</p>
