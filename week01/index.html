      <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>Since there have been no meeting this first week, I think this question is not applicable.
        However, I can report that this week I have spent a lot of time reading and checking out
        JavaScript topics. Making the portfolio made me to revise how to use appropriately <span
          class="code-text">forEach()</span> method, for example.</p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>Besides reading of the topics in the assignment, I want to stylize my index page and the
        other portfolio pages. What's more, I'm going to check more advanced JavaScript topics, like
        functions, JSON, and so on.
      </p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?
      </h3>
      <p>I felt overwhelmed this week when I saw the huge amount of readings for this semester. I
        like to read so much, but technical readings can be a little stressing. However, I thought
        that the unique way to get mastering on a topic is reading and applying, so I have to put my
        best. Anothe blocker can be the time. I've taken advantage of any free time in the week,
        even when I was on the bus. I hope this effort be worthy.</p>
