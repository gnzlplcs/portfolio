      <h2>Weekly Report 5</h2>
      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>From last meeting, I was checking my notes, and looking for complementary content about the week topic. I spent regular time reading the assignment, but I did not take notes because I read mainly in the transportation. However, I took notes later.</p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>I'll try to start early in the week with my notes, in order to not delay my assignment. On the other hand, I think I need to code more and more. I feel like I spend all my time reading the assignments, but not spend enough time practicing. I have to put my hands in this seriously.
      </p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?
      </h3>
      <p>This week, the team assignment was my blocker. My teammate and me spent so much time trying to deploy the assignment, but we failed. All the code was fine—I think—, but it didn't run. We need to develop a method to deal with an implementation.</p>
