      <h2>Weekly Report 10</h2>
      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>This week I've tried to start early in the week with the readings. Besides I could read them, I've spent time watching and practicing code  from tutorials, specificalli from Traversy Media and FreeCodeCamp; indeed, the practice code for this week I took from a Traversy Media tutorial about Fetch API.</p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>I need to put my max concentration on my final project. This week I've been planning and thinking how to do my app but I think it's time to put my hands on work. At the same time, I need to recap my notes and the documentation that you have provided us.
      </p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?
      </h3>
      <p>There are some concepts I did not understand very well yet, but I've realized that to watch and practice code from online examples makes me more efficient in coding. Time is likely the most important blocker I have.My kids, my job, and my calling have plotted against me to loss my little time to study, but I hope I can achieve the requirement in my final project.</p>
