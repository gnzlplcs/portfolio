      <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>
        From the last meeting I have read a lot; not just the assigned lectures, but also some links and tutorials, both in English as in Spanish. I’ve practiced code in an online repo, Replit, in order to test the results quickly. What’s more, last Friday we had our first team meeting, although our team just remained two students. My teammate, Vanessa, and I were talking about functions and how to implement them in our assignment. She put the code in Github and we can give feedback from there.
      </p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>As our team is concerned, we have made arrangements to have a brief meeting on Mondays and a more extended meeting on Fridays. The idea is we can check the weekly assignments and develop them during the week, and then, on the weekend, joining so that we can deploy our contributions. On the other hand, concerning my personal study, I have to organize to myself better, because this week I read all the assignments, but chapter 4 I had to read very fast.</p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?
      </h3>
      <p>Time is my principal blocker. I wanted to leave my work so that I could have enough time to study all day, but I know that’s not possible. However, I take advantage of my lunch time, transportation time, and any moment to read, but not always it’s possible to take notes. However, I’ve realized how important taking notes is. I can recall concepts in my own way, and this is a good manner to learn. Another blocker I can mention is there have been a couple of concepts a little difficult to understand: Map and Set. These topics are entirely new for me, and I suppose I have to delve more in them.</p>
