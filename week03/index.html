      <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>I've read a lot, over and over again. Early in the week I was reading the wrong chapter,
        and realized my mistake on Thursday!! However, I did my best in order to read all the
        assignments. Vanessa and me made arrangements by Telegram about the weekly code.</p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>Despite trying to organize my weekly readings, time is very short, because some topics are
        a little abstrat to me yet. I'll start early in the week, and try to do old the book's
        examples. Nexto Monday, Vanessa and me are going to meet together by Zoom.
      </p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?
      </h3>
      <p>This week topics were deepen and struggling. When I read the book I felt like understood
        all the concepts, but in the team practice it took too long to do the exercises, especially
        with <span class="code-text">reduce()</span> method. Althought the reading assignments are
        many, I'll llok for time in order to recap viewed topics.</p>
