      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>I've spent a lot of time watching videos about MVC and API Fetch. I have to admit that the final project is very stressing for me. That is the reason because I'm trying to recopile information, documentation, tricks, whatever, in order to implement it on my code.</p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>This week I have to work in the project all the time. I'll check the Hikes assignment so that I can practice modularity.</p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?

What's more, sometimes I think whether it would not be a good idea to take this course again, because I would really like to learn JavaScript like a ninja. Anyway, my final project should be which decides.</p>
