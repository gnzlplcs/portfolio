      <h2>Weekly Report 8</h2>
      <h3>What did I do since the last meeting?
      </h3>
      <p>I've done the same routine from last weeks, checking my notes, taking new notes, watching tutorials, trying to practice all the code I watch and read.</p>
      <h3>What am I going to do next?
      </h3>
      <p>I suppose following the same routine, but putting emphasize in practicing the code. I've found some YouTube channels pretty useful, and I think I can practice their examples as well.
      </p>
      <h3>What are my blockers?
      </h3>
      <p>I am my own blocker. Many times I think I'm completing the assignments just for meet the requirements, but I feel I have not spend enough time to analyze the concepts, specially these last three or two weeks. This situation makes me feel overwhelmed. Other times, I think if really someday I will get work programming, due to my age, my little experience, and when these thoughts come to my mind my focus fails. However, I'm still here, dealing with the English, with JS abstract concepts, and my reduced time. This was not a good week.
